Interest in emulating the properties of biological muscles that allow for fast adaptability and control in
unstructured environments has motivated researchers to develop new soft actuators, often referred to as ‘artificial
muscles’. The field of soft robotics is evolving rapidly as new soft actuator designs are published every year. In
parallel, recent studies have also provided new insights for understanding biological muscles as ‘active’ materials whose
tunable properties allow them to adapt rapidly to external perturbations. This work presents a comparative study
of biological muscles and soft actuators, focusing on those properties that make biological muscles highly adaptable
systems. In doing so, we briefly review the latest soft actuation technologies, their actuation mechanisms, and
advantages and disadvantages from an operational perspective. Next, we review the latest advances in understanding
biological muscles. This presents insight into muscle architecture, the actuation mechanism, and modeling, but more
importantly, it provides an understanding of the properties that contribute to adaptability and control. Finally,
we conduct a comparative study of biological muscles and soft actuators. Here, we present the accomplishments
of each soft actuation technology, the remaining challenges, and future directions. Additionally, this comparative
study contributes to providing further insight on soft robotic terms, such as biomimetic actuators, artificial muscles,
and conceptualizing a higher level of performance actuator named artificial supermuscle. In conclusion, while soft
actuators often have performance metrics such as specific power, efficiency, response time, and others similar to those
in muscles, significant challenges remain when finding suitable substitutes for biological muscles, in terms of other
factors such as control strategies, onboard energy integration, and thermoregulation.
