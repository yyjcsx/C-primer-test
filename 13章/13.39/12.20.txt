Mathematical models of proprioceptors. I. Control and transduction in
the muscle spindle. J Neurophysiol 96: 1772–1788, 2006. First published May 3, 2006; doi:10.1152/jn.00868.2005. We constructed a
physiologically realistic model of a lower-limb, mammalian muscle
spindle composed of mathematical elements closely related to the
anatomical components found in the biological spindle. The spindle
model incorporates three nonlinear intrafusal fiber models (bag1, bag2,
and chain) that contribute variously to action potential generation of
primary and secondary afferents. A single set of model parameters
was optimized on a number of data sets collected from feline soleus
muscle, accounting accurately for afferent activity during a variety of
ramp, triangular, and sinusoidal stretches. We also incorporated the
different temporal properties of fusimotor activation as observed in
the twitchlike chain fibers versus the toniclike bag fibers. The model
captures the spindle’s behavior both in the absence of fusimotor
stimulation and during activation of static or dynamic fusimotor
efferents. In the case of simultaneous static and dynamic fusimotor
efferent stimulation, we demonstrated the importance of including the
experimentally observed effect of partial occlusion. The model was
validated against data that originated from the cat’s medial gastrocnemius muscle and were different from the data used for the parameter determination purposes. The validation record included recently
published experiments in which fusimotor efferent and spindle afferent activities were recorded simultaneously during decerebrate locomotion in the cat. This model will be useful in understanding the role
of the muscle spindle and its fusimotor control during both natural and
pathological motor behavior.
